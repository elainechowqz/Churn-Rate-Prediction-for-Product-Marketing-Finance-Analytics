# Customer Churn Prediction: Data-Driven Retention at a Multi-National Bank

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a multi-national bank to develop a predictive model for customer churn. The primary objective is to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and accurately predict high-risk users. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, this project aims to provide data-driven strategies for product, marketing and financial optimization, ultimately enhancing customer retention.

**Business Problem and Deliverables**

Customer churn poses a significant challenge for the multi-national bank, impacting revenue and customer lifetime value. This project aims to address this problem by delivering the following:

* A comprehensive data analysis and visualization report on customer churn, providing actionable insights.
* A trained Random Forest machine learning model for accurate churn prediction.
* A set of data-driven business recommendations (product, marketing, finance) to improve customer retention and optimize product and marketing strategies.

**Remarks and Key Visualization**

Below is a plot of the feature importances from the predictive model. For more details of the data analysis, machine learning modeling, data visualizations, insights, and business recommendations, see the Jupyter Notebook in the repo.
