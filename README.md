# Customer Churn Prediction: Data-Driven Retention at a Multi-National Bank

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a multi-national bank to develop a predictive model for customer churn. The primary objective is to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and accurately predict high-risk users. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, this project aims to provide data-driven strategies for product, marketing and financial optimization, ultimately enhancing customer retention.

**Business Problem:**

Customer churn poses a significant challenge for the multi-national bank, impacting revenue and customer lifetime value. This project aims to address this problem by delivering the following:

* A comprehensive data analysis and visualization report on customer churn, providing actionable insights.
* A trained Random Forest machine learning model for accurate churn prediction.
* A set of data-driven business recommendations (product, marketing, finance) to improve customer retention and optimize product and marketing strategies.
