# Churn Rate Prediction 
# for Product, Marketing and Financial Analytics at a Multi-national Bank

Data: all users who hit an e-commerce site: whether they converted or not as well as some of their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are new to the site and the number of pages visited (as a proxy for site activity/time spent on site).

The goal is to predict conversion rate via a machine learning model (with the end-to-end model pipeline), and come up with recommendations for the product and marketing teams to improve user conversion rate.
