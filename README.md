# Conversion Rate Prediction for Product and Marketing

We have data about all users who hit an e-commerce site: whether they converted or not as well as some of their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are repeat users and the number of pages visited during that session (as a proxy for site activity/time spent on site).

Our goal is to predict conversion rate via a machine learning model (with the end-to-end model pipeline), and come up with recommendations for the product and marketing teams to improve user conversion rate.
